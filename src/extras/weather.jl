Plots and/or retrieve weather data obtained from the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) API.
Please consult the site for further details. You will find that there are many variables available to plot and with
not so obvious names. There are also _forecast_ and _archive_ versions of the variables. This function tries to guess
that from the variable names. That list of variable names is a bit extensive and we are not reproducing it entirely here,
but given it interest for climatological reason, we do list the so called ``daily`` variables.

- `variable`: "temperature_2m_max", "temperature_2m_min", "apparent_temperature_max", "apparent_temperature_min", "precipitation_sum", "rain_sum", "snowfall_sum", "precipitation_hours", "sunshine_duration", "daylight_duration", "wind_speed_10m_max", "wind_gusts_10m_max", "wind_direction_10m_dominant", "shortwave_radiation_sum", "et0_fao_evapotranspiration"

A word of aknowledge is also due to the [WeatherReport.jl](https://github.com/vnegi10/WeatherReport.jl) project
that inspired this function, that is much smaller (~25 LOC) and has no further dependencies than GMT itself.

- `lon` and `lat`: Explicitly provide the coordinates of the location. If not provided, nor the `city` name,
   the current location is used from an IP location service (see the `whereami` function help).
- `city`: The name of the location that will be used. City names are normally OK but if it fails see the help of the
   `geocoder()` function as that is what is used to transform names to coordinates. The default is to use the current
   geographic location of the user.
- `days`: When asking for forecasts this is the number of days to forecast. Maximum is 16 days. Default is 7.
- `starttime`: Limit to events on or after the specified start time. NOTE: All times use ISO8601 Date/Time format
    OR a DateTime type. Default is NOW - 30 days.
- `endtime`: Limit to events on or before the specified end time. Same remarks as for `starttime`. Default is present time.
- `last`: If value is an integer (*e.g.* `last=90`), select the events in the last n days. If it is a string
   than we expect that it ends with a 'w'(eek), 'm'(onth) or 'y'(ear). Example: `last="2Y"` (period code is caseless)
- `year`: An integer, restrict data download to this year.
- `debug`: Print the url of the requested data and return.
- `data`: The default is to make a seismicity map but if the `data` option is used (containing whatever)
    we return the data in a ``GMTdataset`` 
- `figname`: $(opt_savefig)
- `show`: By default this function just returns the data in a `GMTdataset` but if `show=true` it shows the plot.
   Use `data=true` to also return the data even when `show=true`.

### Examples
```julia
# Plot the temperature forecast of your location. Also returns the data table.
D = weather(data=true, show=true)
```
```julia
# Plot the rain fall during 2023 at Copenhagen
weather(city="Copenhagen", year=2023, variable="rain_sum", show=true)
```

"""
	gmtwhich(cmd0::String; kwargs...)

Find full path to specified files

See full GMT docs at [`gmtwhich`]($(GMTdoc)gmtwhich.html)

Parameters
----------

- **A** | **readable** :: [Type => Bool]

	Only consider files that the user has permission to read [Default consider all files found].
- **C** | **confirm** :: [Type => Bool]

	Instead of reporting the paths, print the confirmation Y if the file is found and N if it is not.
- **D** | **report_dir** :: [Type => Bool]

	Instead of reporting the paths, print the directories that contains the files.
- **G** | **download** :: [Type => Str | []]      ``Arg = [c|l|u]``

	If a file argument is a downloadable file (either a full URL, a @file for downloading from
	the GMT Site Cache, or @earth_relief_*.grd) we will try to download the file if it is not
	found in your local data or cache dirs.

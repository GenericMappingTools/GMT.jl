The Generic Mapping Tools, **GMT**, is an open source collection of tools for manipulating geographic
and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing
PostScript illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated
surfaces and 3D perspective views.

will take you to an impressive collection of figures made with **GMT**

This wrapper works with GMT5.3.1 and above and it is intended not only to access to **GMT** from
within the Julia language but also to provide a more modern interface to the **GMT** modules.
For example, instead of using the **GMT** classic syntax to do a line plot:

    gmt psxy filename -R0/10/0/5 -JX12 -W1p -Ba -P > psfile.ps

one can simply do:

    plot("filename", show=true)

or, more verbose but easier to read

    coast(region=:global, proj=:Winkel, frame=:g, area=10000,
          land=:burlywood4, water=:wheat1, figsize=12, show=true)

instead of

    gmt coast -Rd -JR12 -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Gburlywood4 -Swheat1 -P > GMT_winkel.ps

Install
=======

    ]add GMT

A word of warning about the installation. The *GMT.jl* Julia wrapper does **NOT** install the
[GMT](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt) program. It's the user responsability to do that.

  * Windows64
      It's better to install the [GMT6 version](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/releases/download/6.0.0rc3/GMT-6.0.0rc3-win64.exe)

  * Windows32

      Download and install the official version at (the [..._win32.exe](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/releases/download/6.0.0rc3/GMT-6.0.0rc3-win32.exe))

  * Unix
  
      Follow instructions at <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt#install-gmt>

  * In any case, since *GMT* produces PostScript you need a PS visualizer

      Install `Ghostscript` and `ghostview` at <https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html>

On OSX, with a manual GMT build and dependencies obtained with Homebrew (that are installed at
/user/local/lib), I had to help Julia finding MY *libgmt.dylib*, with (this line should than be
added to the ~/.julia/config/startup.jl file)

    push!(Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH, "/Users/j/programs/gmt5/lib")

Using
=====

The *GMT* Julia wrapper was designed to work in a way the close as possible to the command line version
and yet to provide all the facilities of the Julia language. In this sense, all **GMT** options are put
in a single text string that is passed, plus the data itself when it applies, to the ``gmt()`` command.
However, we also acknowledge that not every one is comfortable with the *GMT* syntax. This syntax is
needed to accommodate the immense pool of options that let you control all details of a figure but that
also makes it harder to read/master.

To make life easier we provide also a new mechanism that use the **GMT** module name directly and where
the program's options are set via keyword arguments. While the monolotic way of using this package is
robust and keeps being updated to latestes **GMT** developments, this *By modules* alternative is a Work
In Progress (the **GMT supplements** were not ported yet) and some things may not work yet. So all help
is most than wellcome.

The Generic Mapping Tools, **GMT**, is an open source collection of tools for manipulating geographic
and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing
PostScript illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated
surfaces and 3D perspective views.

will take you to an impressive collection of figures made with **GMT**

This wrapper works with GMT6.4.0 and above and it is intended not only to access to **GMT** from
within the Julia language but also to provide a more modern interface to the **GMT** modules.
For example, instead of using the **GMT** classic syntax to do a line plot:

    gmt psxy filename -R0/10/0/5 -JX12 -W1p -Ba -P > psfile.ps

one can simply do:

    plot("filename", show=true)

or, more verbose but easier to read

    coast(region=:global, proj=:Winkel, frame=:g, area=10000,
          land=:burlywood4, water=:wheat1, show=true)

instead of

    gmt coast -Rd -JR12 -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Gburlywood4 -Swheat1 -P > GMT_winkel.ps

to show

Install
=======

    ] add GMT

A word about the installation. On Unix (Mac included) we now use a GMT_jll artifact to provide the GMT binary,
but for Windows we keep using a MSVC GMT binary. This means that on Windows the GMT (the C lib) is not updated
automatically (but GMT.jl is). Updates there are done manually by running ``upGMT()``. Also, for some reasons
it may be desirable to use a system wide GMT installation. To swap to a system wide GMT installation, do (in REPL):

- ENV["SYSTEMWIDE_GMT"] = 1;
- import Pkg; Pkg.build("GMT")
- restart Julia

Note the above will work up until some other reason triggers a Julia recompile, where the JLL artifacts 
will be used again. To make the ENV["SYSTEMWIDE_GMT"] = 1 solution permanent, declare a "SYSTEMWIDE_GMT"
environment variable permanently in your .bashrc (or whatever).

Using
=====

The *GMT* Julia wrapper was designed to work in a way the close as possible to the command line version
and yet to provide all the facilities of the Julia language. In this sense, all **GMT** options are put
in a single text string that is passed, plus the data itself when it applies, to the ``gmt()`` command.
However, we also acknowledge that not every one is comfortable with the *GMT* syntax. This syntax is
needed to accommodate the immense pool of options that let you control all details of a figure but that
also makes it harder to read/master.

To make life easier we provide also a new mechanism that use the **GMT** module name directly and where
the program's options are set via keyword arguments. While the monolotic way of using this package is
robust and keeps being updated to latestes **GMT** developments, this *By modules* alternative is a Work
in Progress (several of the **GMT supplements** were not ported yet) and some things may not work yet.
So all help is most than wellcome.

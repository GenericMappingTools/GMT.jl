The Generic Mapping Tools, **GMT**, is an open source collection of tools for manipulating geographic
and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing
PostScript illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated
surfaces and 3D perspective views.

This wrapper works only with GMT5.3.1 and above

Install
=======

    Pkg.add("GMT")

On OSX, with a manual GMT build and dependencies obtained with Homebrew (that are installed at
/user/local/lib), I had to help Julia finding MY *libgmt.dylib*, with (this line should than be
added to the ~/.juliarc.jl file)

    push!(Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH, "/Users/j/programs/gmt5/lib")

Using
=====

The *GMT* Julia wrapper was designed to work in a way the close as possible to the command line version
and yet to provide all the facilities of the Julia language. In this sense, all **GMT** options are put
in a single text string that is passed, plus the data itself when it applies, to the ``gmt()`` command.
However, we also acknowledge that not every one is comfortable with the *GMT* syntax. This syntax is
needed to accommodate the immense pool of options that let you control all details of a figure but that
also makes it harder to read/master.

To make life easier for simple plots we provide also a more limited sub-set of commands that use the
**GMT** module name directly and where the image details are set via keyword arguments. While the
monolotic way of using this package is robust and keeps being updated to latestes **GMT** developments,
this *By modules* alternative is a very Work In Progress and many things may not work yet. So all help is
most than wellcome.

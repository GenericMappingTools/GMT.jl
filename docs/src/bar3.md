# bar3

	bar3(cmd0::String="", arg1=[]; kwargs...)

Plots a 3D bar graph. The input can either be a file name of a file with at least three columns (x,y,z),
but optionally more, a GMTdatset object with also three or more columns. However, the simplest usage is
to provide a grid object (a GMTgrid) or a MxN matrix (with M,N > 3) and accept the defaults set for these
data types. When `not` using grids or matrices the *width* keyword (see below) is mandatory, unless both
`xsize` and `ysize` are given as two extra data columns.

This module is a subset of `plot` to make it simpler to draw 3D bar plots. So not all (fine)
controlling parameters are listed here. For a finer control, user should consult the `plot` module.

Parameters
----------

- **B** or *axis* or *frame*\
  Set map boundary frame and axes attributes. Default is to draw and annotate left, bottom and vertical
  axes and just draw left and tp axes. More at [axis](@ref)

- **J** or *proj* : *proj=<parameters>*\
  Select map projection. Default is linear and 12 cm width. More at [proj](@ref)

- **R** or *region* or *limits* : -- *limits=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)* **|** *limits=(BB=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax),)*
   **|** ...more\
   Specify the region of interest. Default limits are computed from data extents. More at [limits](@ref)

- **G** or *markerfacecolor* or *MarkerFaceColor* or *mc* or *fill*\
   Select color or pattern for filling of bars [Default is default color]. See [Setting color](@ref) for extend
   color selection (including color map generation).

- *bar*\
   column (3-D) extending from base to *z*. By default, base is 0 and the bar widths are 0.85 of the width in
   x-units. You can change this by using (in alternative):
     - *width=xx*\
        where *xx* is the bar width in x-units (bar base remains = 0).
     - *base=xx*\
        where *xx* is the base value (bar width remains = 0.85).
     - *bar=??*\
        where *??* is a string with a full GMT syntax for this option (**-Sb**)
     - *bar=(width=xx,unit=xx,base=xx,height=xx)*\
        Full featured option. Attention, the order of members matters. *unit* must always come after *width*,
        but otherwise they are all optional.
       - *width*\
          The bar width in x-units. To specify it in plot units, use the *unit* member with `cm`, `inch` or `point`.
       - *unit*\
          In case *width* is given in plot units. Valid units are cm`, `inch` or `point`.
       - *base=xx*\
          where *xx* is the base value.
       - *height*\
          If the bar height is measured relative to base *xx* [Default is relative to origin].
          Cannot be used together with *base*.
   The facet colors will be modified to simulate shading. Use *noshade=true* to disable such 3-D illumination.
   Normally a single *z* value is considered. For multi-band columns, use *nbands=n* (and provide *n* z-values
   on input; these must be monotonically increasing up the column) or *Nbands=n* (and expect *n* of dz
   increments that must be summed to yield actual *z* values). The multi-band column symbol requires a
   *fill=cmap* (*i.e.* the use of a colormap) and will use the band number (0, 1, nbands-1) to assign the band
   color. The way to use these options is also as a separate keyword, or as an extra member of the *bar* tuple.
     - *nbands=n* or *Nbands=n*
   or
     - *bar=(width=xx,unit=xx,base=xx,height=xx,nbands=xx)*  (or *Nbands=xx* for last element)

- **p** or *view*\
   Default is viewpoint` from an azimuth of 200 and elevation of 30 degrees.\
   Specify the viewpoint in terms of azimuth and elevation. The azimuth is the horizontal rotation about the z-axis as measured in degrees from the positive y-axis. That is, from North. This option is not yet fully
   expanded. Current alternatives are:
     - *view=??*\
        A full GMT compact string with the full set of options.
     - *view=(azim,elev)*\
        A two elements tuple with azimuth and elevation

Examples
--------

A simple scatter of ten points plotted as red circles of 7 points size

```julia
G = gmt("grdmath -R-15/15/-15/15 -I0.5 X Y HYPOT DUP 2 MUL PI MUL 8 DIV COS EXCH NEG 10 DIV EXP MUL =");
cmap = grd2cpt(G);      # Compute a colormap with the grid's data range
bar3(G, lw=:thinnest, color=cmap, fmt=:png, show=true)
```

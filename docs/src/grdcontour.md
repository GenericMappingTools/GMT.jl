# grdcontour

	grdcontour(cmd0::String="", arg1=[]; kwargs...)

Make contour map using a grid.

Read a 2-D grid and produces a contour map by tracing each contour through the grid. Various options
that affect the plotting are available. Alternatively, the *x, y, z* positions of the contour lines may be
saved to one or more output files (or memory) and no plot is produced.

Required Arguments
------------------

The 2-D gridded data set to be contoured.

- **J** or *proj* : *proj=<parameters>*\
   Select map projection. More at [proj](@ref)

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **A** or *annot* : *annot=annot_int* **|** *annot=(int=annot_int, disable=true, single=true, labels=labelinfo)*\
  *annot_int* is annotation interval in data units; it is ignored if contour levels are given in a file.
  [Default is no annotations]. Use *annot=(disable=true,)* to disable all annotations implied by **cont**.
  Alternatively do *annot=(single=true, int=val)* to plot *val* as a single contour. The optional *labelinfo* controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists of the following control arguments [`Label formatting`](@ref label_format_quot)

- **B** or *axis* or *frame*\
  Set map boundary frame and axes attributes. More at [axis](@ref)

- **C** or *cont* or *contours* or *levels* : *cont=cont_int*\
  The contours to be drawn may be specified in one of three possible ways:

   1. If *cont_int* has the suffix ".cpt" and can be opened as a file, it is assumed to be a CPT.
      The color boundaries are then used as contour levels. If the CPT has annotation flags in the
      last column then those contours will be annotated. By default all contours are labeled;
      use *annot=(disable=true,))* (or *annot="-"*) to disable all annotations.

   2. If *cont_int* is a file but not a CPT, it is expected to contain contour levels in column 1 and a
      C(ontour) OR A(nnotate) in col 2. The levels marked C (or c) are contoured, the levels marked A
      (or a) are contoured and annotated. Optionally, a third column maybe present and contain the
      fixed annotation angle for this contour level.

   3. If no file is found, then *cont_int* is interpreted as a constant contour interval. However,
      if prepended with the + sign (hence it has to be a string) the *cont_int* is taken as meaning draw that
      single contour. The *annot* option offers the same possibility so they may be used together to plot a
      single annotated contour and another single non-annotated contour, as in *anot="+10", cont="+5"* that
      plots an annotated 10 contour and an non-annotated 5 contour.
      If **annot** is set and **cont** is not, then the contour interval is set equal to the specified
      annotation interval. Note to specify a negative value you must still prepend the +, as in *cont="+-10"*.

  If a file is given and **ticks** is set, then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tick-marks. In all cases the contour values have the same units as the grid. Finally, if neither **cont** nor **annot** are set then we auto-compute suitable contour and annotation intervals from the data range, yielding 10-20 contours.

- **D** or *dump* : *dump=fname*\
  Dump contours as data line segments; no plotting takes place. Append filename template which may contain
  C-format specifiers. If no filename template is given we write all lines to stdout. If filename has no
  specifiers then we write all lines to a single file. If a float format (e.g., %6.2f) is found we substitute
  the contour z-value. If an integer format (e.g., %06d) is found we substitute a running segment count. If
  an char format (%c) is found we substitute C or O for closed and open contours. The 1-3 specifiers may be
  combined and appear in any order to produce the the desired number of output files (e.g., just %c gives
  two files, just %f would separate segments into one file per contour level, and %d would write all segments
  to individual files; see manual page for more examples.

- **-F** or *force* : *force=true* **|** *force=:left* **|** *force=:right*\
  Force dumped contours to be oriented so that higher z-values are to the left (*force=:left*) or right
  (*force=:right*) as we move along the contour [Default is arbitrary orientation]. Requires **dump**.

- **G** or *labels* : *labels=()*\
  The required argument controls the placement of labels along the quoted lines. Choose among five
  controlling algorithms as explained in [`Placement methods`](@ref placement_method_quot)

- **L** or *range* : *range=(low,high)* **|** *range=:n|:p|:N|:P*\
  Limit range: Do not draw contours for data values below *low* or above *high*.  Alternatively,
  limit contours to negative (*range=:n*) or positive (*range=:p*) contours. Use upper case *N* or *P*
  to include the zero contour.

- **N** or *fill* : *fill=color*\
  Fill the area between contours using the discrete color table given by *color*, a [Setting color](@ref) element.
  Then, **cont** and **annot** can be used as well to control the contour lines and annotations. If no *color*
  is set (*fill=[]*) then a discrete color setting must be given via **cont** instead.

- **Q** or *cut* : *cut=np* **|** *cut=length&unit[+z]*\
  Do not draw contours with less than *np* number of points [Draw all contours]. Alternatively, give
  instead a minimum contour length in distance units, including **c** (Cartesian distances using user
  coordinates) or **C** for plot length units in current plot units after projecting the coordinates.
  Optionally, append **+z** to exclude the zero contour.

- **R** or *region* or *limits* : *limits=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)* **|** *limits=(BB=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax),)*
   **|** *limits=(LLUR=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax),units="unit")* **|** ...more 
   Specify the region of interest. More at [limits](@ref)

- **S** or *smooth* : *smooth=smoothfactor*\
  Used to resample the contour lines at roughly every (*gridbox_size/smoothfactor*) interval.

- **T** or *ticks* : *ticks=(local_high=true, local_low=true, gap=gap, closed=true, labels=labels)*\
  Will draw tick marks pointing in the downward direction every *gap* along the innermost closed contours only;
  set *closed=true* to tick all closed contours. Use *gap=(gap,length)* and optionally tick mark *length*
  (append units as **c**, **i**, or **p**) or use defaults [*"15p/3p"*]. User may choose to tick only local
  highs or local lows by specifying *local_high=true*, *local_low=true*, respectively. Set *labels* to
  annotate the centers of closed innermost contours (i.e., the local lows and highs). If no *labels* (*i.e*,
  set *labels=""*) is set, we use - and + as the labels. Appending exactly two characters, *e.g.*, *labels=:LH*,
  will plot the two characters (here, *L* and *H*) as labels. For more elaborate labels, separate the low and hight
  label strings with a comma (*e.g.*, *labels="lo,hi"*). If a file is given by **cont**, and **ticks** is set,
  then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tick marks [and annotations]. 


- **W** or *pen* : *pen=(annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen)*\
  *annot=true*, if present, means to annotated contours or *contour=true* for regular contours [Default].
  The *pen* sets the attributes for the particular line. Default pen for annotated contours: *pen=(0.75,:black)*.
  Regular contours use *pen=(0.25,:black)*. Normally, all contours are drawn with a fixed color determined by
  the pen setting. This option may be repeated, for example to separate contour and annotated contours settings.
  For that the syntax changes to use a Tuple of NamedTuples, *e.g.*  *pen=((annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen), (annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen))*.

- **Z** or *scale* : *scale=factor* **|** *scale=(factor=factor, shift=shift, periodic=true)*\
  Use to subtract *shift* from the data and multiply the results by *factor* before contouring starts.
  (Numbers in **annot**, **cont**, **range** refer to values after this scaling has occurred.) Use *periodic=true*
  to indicate that this grid file contains z-values that are periodic in 360 degrees (e.g., phase data, angular distributions) and that special precautions must be taken when determining 0-contours.

- **U** or *stamp* : *stamp=true* **|** *stamp=(just="code", pos=(dx,dy), label="label", com=true)*\
   Draw GMT time stamp logo on plot. More at [stamp](@ref)

- **V** or *verbose* : *verbose=true* **|** *verbose=level*\
   Select verbosity level. More at [verbose](@ref)

- **W** or *pen* : *pen=pen*\
   Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid].

- **X** or *x_off* or *x_offset* : *x_off=[] **|** *x_off=x-shift* **|** *x_off=(shift=x-shift, mov="a|c|f|r")*\
   Shift plot origin. More at [x_off](@ref)

- **Y** or *y_off* or *y_offset* : *y_off=[] **|** *y_off=y-shift* **|** *y_off=(shift=y-shift, mov="a|c|f|r")*\
   Shift plot origin. More at [y_off](@ref)

Examples
--------

Contour the *peaks* function. *cont=1* and *annot=2* means draw contours at every 1 unit of the *G*
grid and annotate at every other contour line:

```julia
    G = GMT.peaks();
    grdcontour(G, cont=1, annot=2, fmt=:png, show=true)
```

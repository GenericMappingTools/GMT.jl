# bar

	bar(cmd0::String="", arg1=[]; kwargs...)

Reads (x,y) pairs and plots a bar graph. This module is a subset of `plot` to make it simpler to draw bar
plots. So not all (fine) controlling parameters are listed here. For a finer control, user should
consult the `plot` module. 

Parameters
----------

- **B** or *axis* or *frame*\
  Set map boundary frame and axes attributes. Default is to draw and annotate left and bottom axes.
  More at [axis](@ref)

- **J** or *proj* : *proj=<parameters>*\
  Select map projection. Default is linear and 14 cm width. More at [proj](@ref)

- **R** or *region* or *limits* : *limits=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)* **|** *limits=(BB=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax),)*
   **|** *limits=(LLUR=(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax),units="unit")* **|** ...more \
   Specify the region of interest. Default limits are computed from data extents. More at [limits](@ref)

- **G** or *markerfacecolor* or *mc* or *fill*\
   Select color or pattern for filling of symbols [Default is no fill]. Note that plot will search for *fill*
   and *pen* settings in all the segment headers (when passing a GMTdaset or file of a multi-segment dataset)
   and let any values thus found over-ride the command line settings (but those must be provided in the terse GMT
   syntax). See [Setting color](@ref) for extend color selection (including color map generation).

- *bar*\
   Vertical bar extending from base to *y*. By default, base is 0 and the bar widths are 0.8 of the width in
   x-units. You can change this by using (in alternative):
     - *width=xx*\
        where *xx* is the bar width in x-units (bar base remains = 0).
     - *base=xx*\
        where *xx* is the base value (bar width remains = 0.8).
     - *bar=??*\
        where *??* is a string with a full GMT syntax for this option (**-Sb**)
     - *bar=(width=xx,unit=xx,base=xx,height=xx)*\
        Attention, the order of members matters but only *width* is mandatory.
       - *width*\
          The bar width in x-units. To specify it in plot units, use the *unit* member with `cm`, `inch` or `point`.
       - *unit*\
          In case *width* is given in plot units. Valid units are `cm`, `inch` or `point`.
       - *base=xx*\
          where *xx* is the base value.
       - *height*\
          If the bar height is measured relative to base *xx* [Default is relative to origin].
          Cannot be used together with *base*.

- *hbar*\
   Horizontal bar extending from base to x. Same as *bar* but now with respect to y axis, except that one
   cannot use *width* or *base* to change just those defaults (the use of it is restricted to the vertical
   bars case).


Examples
--------

A simple bar plot with 10 bars and automatic limits.

```julia
    bar(rand(10), show=true)
```
